- 👋 Hi, I’m @clerical-jp, the support staff of academia and the beginner of programing.
- 👀 I’m interested in making useful tools for academia in Japan. Researchers have a lot of paper works and some bullshit jobs except their research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to develop some useful tools for them.
- 💞️ Someday I’m looking to collaborate on the useful tools for academia.
